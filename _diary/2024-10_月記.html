Nevertheless, it was still useful for me in some sense.<br><br>In particular, Chapters 9 and 10, where the author presents his philosophy about research, were really impressive. He says that the ultimate goal of humanities (人文学) is the social revolution. He asserts that any kind of violence is evil, and humanities are devoted to correcting such violence, inequality, and disparity. The motivation for his research seems to be joining and contributing to such academic activity, which is quite convincing and resembles my motivation to do scientific research.<br><br>Anyway, I'd like to summarize with quotation and interpret the contents of Chapters 1 to 8 for my research in the following.<br><br>In Chapter 1, the author defines the thesis as "an article to prove an argument."<br>What I felt most important is that the argument must be "some assertion which requires proof, not just observations or facts, and be presented under the author's responsibility."<br>This statement holds true not only for humanities but also for science. We need to clarify the theorem or statement at the beginning of the paper, and we should pay attention to whether it satisfies the condition above. In particular, when we state our main result in the introduction section, I tend to fail to meet the conditions. Consciousness of the "argument" would lead to better scientific sentences.<br><br>In Chapter 2, the author discusses the quality of the argument. He says that the argument must have some academic value, and its value can be defined by whether the current academic "conversation" can be updated by your argument. In science, it is often referred to as the novelty (新規性) of the research. Such literary expression (update the conversation) is relatively fresh and exciting.&nbsp; Actually, there was no word "新規性" in this book. This might be one of the significant differences between humanities and science. Novelty might not always be required in the humanities because the ultimate goal is the social revolution, as the author said. To revolve society, we only need to point out the drawbacks and update people's values or ways of thinking, not giving completely new ideas. Thus, according to him, the thesis (in humanities) does not necessarily require the research question. What is needed is just the academic value of the argument. I don't know whether this holds true for science, but this statement was intriguing.<br><br>Chapter 3 (about paragraph writing) resembles the statement in another book I read, so I skip this part.</p><p name="2dfea701-5cc0-4295-b4c0-122f41abb364" id="2dfea701-5cc0-4295-b4c0-122f41abb364">In Chapter 4, the author introduces "Uneven U" by Eric Hayot.</p><p name="316cb5cf-cde4-48dc-bcbe-92ca31244029"><a href="https://universityaffairs.ca/career-advice/ask-dr-editor/crafting-a-strong-conclusion-to-your-journal-article-or-book-chapter/">https://universityaffairs.ca/career-advice/ask-dr-editor/crafting-a-strong-conclusion-to-your-journal-article-or-book-chapter/</a></p><figure name="19d0be8c-f17b-4b81-9747-8da39d9c1df4" id="19d0be8c-f17b-4b81-9747-8da39d9c1df4"><img src="/diary/assets/nd3f7bf2b8db5_1729044373-gIisZWqHcm5v9wBo42Oyakp0.png" alt="" width="485" height="419"><figcaption>The y-axis shows the abstraction level, varying between a fact, an interpretation, and a general abstract statement.<br>By doing so, we can smoothly fill the gap in our statement.</figcaption></figure><figure name="c9dfc4d8-6ceb-44c8-bc4a-c0296cac7cb0" id="c9dfc4d8-6ceb-44c8-bc4a-c0296cac7cb0"><img src="/diary/assets/nd3f7bf2b8db5_1729044386-ZGBCh3vKY1nPrcw98DNpy4L6.png" alt="" width="620" height="433"><figcaption>According to Eric Hayot, the thesis itself should also present a fractal structure of "Uneven U".</figcaption></figure><p name="1262b5bb-ddba-430a-9da9-7a317d55ad4b" id="1262b5bb-ddba-430a-9da9-7a317d55ad4b">I've never heard the "Uneven U", but it was convincing. Such a structure would be better even in a scientific thesis. The tweet below resembles this "Uneven U". Indeed, I wrote my abstract with references to this.</p><p name="93b9e96c-f49a-4b03-8d58-c38871ab77b7"><a href="https://twitter.com/slavov_n/status/1847950639202279554">https://twitter.com/slavov_n/status/1847950639202279554</a></p><p name="3d129920-da37-4815-8f1f-3b2d2ea237ba" id="3d129920-da37-4815-8f1f-3b2d2ea237ba">I want to pay attention to such abstraction levels from now on when I read and write theses.<br><br>In Chapter 5, the author claims that a long paragraph with abundant information and para-phrase is better. However, this is not a good fit for a science thesis. The correctness or persuasiveness in science is apparent from the math equations or logic. Making the paragraph longer might spoil such clearance.&nbsp; However, adding information and para-phrases to smooth the logic enough would be helpful advice when reviewing the previous works. Stating the previous works with an appropriate abstraction level in your own words might enhance the state's persuasive power.<br><br>I will also skip Chapters 6 (citation) and 7(intro) since they differ from my situation, but they were interesting because of the difference between humanities and science.<br><br>In Chapter 8, I was most impressed by the statement: "The conclusion is the only section in which we can embed something not only internal to the thesis but also transcends the thesis." Of course, we cannot embed something too unclear or false transcending statements in the conclusion section. However, we can still mention future works that broaden our research possibilities. Expressing this fact as above is quite stunning.</p><h3 name="c5fcb96d-1d0b-44ed-b020-480a404ee723" id="c5fcb96d-1d0b-44ed-b020-480a404ee723">Paragraph Writing for Scientists</h3><p name="dc9b711a-3370-45c1-b516-4cd10bc8823b"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E3%81%AE%E3%83%91%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%95%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%80%9C%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E8%8B%B1%E8%AA%9E%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7%E8%AB%96%E7%90%86%E7%9A%84%E3%81%AA%E6%96%87%E7%AB%A0%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%81%AE%E5%BF%85%E9%A0%88%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93-%E9%AB%98%E6%A9%8B-%E8%89%AF%E5%AD%90/dp/4758108560">https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E3%81%AE%E3%83%91%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%95%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%80%9C%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E8%8B%B1%E8%AA%9E%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7%E8%AB%96%E7%90%86%E7%9A%84%E3%81%AA%E6%96%87%E7%AB%A0%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%81%AE%E5%BF%85%E9%A0%88%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93-%E9%AB%98%E6%A9%8B-%E8%89%AF%E5%AD%90/dp/4758108560</a></p><p name="917cc372-a853-4130-8510-72c7e8fb3466" id="917cc372-a853-4130-8510-72c7e8fb3466">This book was also beneficial for me.
