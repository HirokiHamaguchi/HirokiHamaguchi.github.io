In recent days, I have become acutely aware of how bad my English writing is. To practice writing in English, I'd like to write this monthly diary in English. This note contains not only events from June but also from April and May. I was too lazy to write this note earlier…

## Naruse ha tenka wo torini iku

In April, Japan Booksellers' Award was given to "Naruse ha tenka wo torini iku". I read the two books in the Naruse series in April. Although the story was not what I expected based on the last year's award-winning book, "Thou, like a Star," both books were interesting.  
One thing that surprised me was that the main character, Naruse, visited to the University of Tokyo. I didn't expect that my university suddenly appear in the story.

In the future, I want to visit Shiga Prefecture, where the book is set.

## May Fes

I visited May Fes.  
I was glad to see that the Plarail calculator was also exhibited. It seems much improved from last year's version, which I helped to create a little.

I happened to meet a junior from my high school. They are now freshmen, and one of them opened a store selling fried ice creme. It was very delicious.

I also wanted to buy some merchandise of May-chan (the sheep mascot of May Fes), but it was sold out. I hope to buy it next year.

## Bouldering

I went bouldering with my friend this June. It was fun, but in the following days, my muscle pain was very bad.

## Honen and Pure Land Buddhism

I went to special exhibition "Honen and Pure Land Buddhism" held in Tokyo National Museum in Ueno.  
I was glad to see "Collected Essays on Birth in the Pure Land (往生要集)," "Passages on the Selection of the Nembutsu in the Original Vow (選択本願念仏集)," "Standing Amida (阿弥陀如来立像)" and "Taima Mandala (當麻曼陀羅図)."

During the application, I was pondering the passage of 850 years. It was the 850th anniversary of the Jodo sect. For me, 850 years does not seem like a very long time. However, I realized that the world, paradigms, and people's values have drastically changed. Nowadays, only a few people believe in Buddha or Amida, I think.  
  
I sometimes consider what the future will be like 1000 years from now. I fully understand that it would be far from our expectations through this exhibition. It might be a sad thing, but at the same time, our existence will not disappear entirely. That is a relief for our life.
