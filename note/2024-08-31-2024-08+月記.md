## Gallery

I went to TOKYO STATION GALLERY to see the exhibition "FOLON: AGENCY OF IMAGINARY JOURNEYS".

It was really fascinating. In particular, the [screen printing](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3) was truly beautiful. I'm not sure if I have seen this kind of work before, but I was really impressed by its vivid coloring. Perhaps the aluminum canvas was essential for achieving such good coloring.

My favorite piece was the picture shown in the following link:

It might be resemble to this one. Although I don't know much about VR Chat, I have seen this figure before (maybe it has a specific name), and it reminded me of it.

Among the exhibits, there were some pieces related to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I was a little confused because I didn't know that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had illustrations, but I was convinced that his illustrations were for a book published by Amnesty International, not the official one.

As a discovery in my daily life, I recognized that the word persona is a prefix of the word **persona**lity. 

I might have been aware of this fact, but recently I recognized it. Languages are interesting.
